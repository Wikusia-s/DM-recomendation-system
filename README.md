# MovieLens-recommendation-system

## Project description

Group name: The Miners
Participants:
1. Lidia Wiśniewska - Code Repository
2. Wiktoria Szarzyńska - Code Repository
2. Joanna Szczublińska - Project Poster
3. Maria Musiał - Project Report

### Dataset name: MovieLens
link to our dataset:
from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)


### Project structure:

Our main goal is to create a recommendation system based on the MovieLens dataset using clustering and association rules. To reproduce the project simply run the jupyter notebook file: main.ipynb.

The report is available in ***MovieLens_report.pdf***.

Inside the code folder, you can find the following files:

- ***recommendation.py*** - the main file with the used functions
- ***main.ipynb*** - reproducible set of samples presented in Jupyter Notebook
- ***testing.ipynb*** - set of tests of the recommendation.py file
- ***ratings.csv*** and ***movies.csv*** datasets used in the assignmnet

### How to use the code

Whole project is created in jupyter notebook which uses functions written in python in recommendation.py file. We load our data in the first place ysing pandas library. This is crucial to continue the creation of recommendation system. To provide the same experiment: download the files mentioned in the repository and also dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
